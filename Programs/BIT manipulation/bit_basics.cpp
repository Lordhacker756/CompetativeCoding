    Ab what operation can we do to return only the bit at the given posn?
    we'll use the logic gates wala logic here,

    dimag lagao, 0101 & 0100 , isme and operator hai now output dekho!
    at index/pos = 3 , 0 & 0 ie 0,
    at index = 2 , 1 & 1, ie 1.
    at index =1 , 0 & 0 , ie 0, and finally at index 0 , we have 1 & 0 ie 0,
    and we're simply returning the result at the given pos,

    btw, "1<<", it means shift the bit by 1 towards the left,
    eg a number is 1011, now we do 1<< on it, it becomes 0110, the one is now omitted an the space at the end is occupied by 0,

    Given posn pr 1 bit set karna hai eg no is 1010 , and pos is 2 , so after setting 1 at 2 well have
    1110, and to do that yaha logic lagega OR gate ka, coz we're returning the orignal number + the bit, hence 1 or 0 will be 1 coz we never know what exactly is at that posn 

    âš Yaha pos jo variable hai na usko we're actually using as an string, mane jasie 2nd position pe bit ko kuch karna hai , so 2nd posn in bit is 0100 as index 0 se start hota but pos ki value to 2 hai ie 0010, isi liye we're shifting the bit,

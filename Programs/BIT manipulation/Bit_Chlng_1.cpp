    THamba re baba, you dont have to first convert the number into binary and count the no of 1's ðŸ˜‚
    Tera faizal tereko usse modern tarika bataiga re ðŸ˜Ž
    now see, as the logic utillized above, 
    
    doing n & n-1 , removes one "1" bit at a time, hai na?
    simply continue that until you get zero, and count the number of times 1 was removed, you'll have your answer!

    noi samajh ayaðŸ¥º

    arre meri jan le example dekh!

    n=19 ie 01011,
    n-1 will be 18 i.e 01010

    now n & n-1 => 01010 ie 18 and count is 1,

    similarly 18 (01010) & 17(01001) => 01001 and count is 2,

    similarly 17(01001) & 16(01000) =>01000 and count is 3,

    now 16(01000) & 15(00111) => 00000 and count becomes 4 and loop breaks and you have your answerðŸ¥°
